Society is rapidly moving towards ``smart cities'' \cite{batty2012smart,al2015applications}, where smart grid and 5G wireless network operators alike can share forecasts to enhance external control applications. This paper presents a preliminary first step towards this goal, by contributing an algorithm to learn task-relevant, compressed representations of timeseries for a control objective. 
%On real datasets spanning diverse engineering domains, our method transmits at least $80\%$ less data and achieves better control performance than today's task-agnostic benchmarks.
Our future work will center around privacy guarantees that constrain learned representations to filter personal features, such as individual mobility patterns. Further, we want to certify our algorithm does not reveal proprietary control logic or private internal states of the downstream controller. While recent work has addressed how to value datasets for supervised learning \cite{ghorbani2019data,agarwal2019marketplace}, a promising extension of our work is to price timeseries datasets for cooperative control in a data-market. Indeed, our ability to gracefully trade-off control cost with data exchange lends itself to an economic analysis. %Overall, we believe our work is a valuable first step to learning efficient representations for networked control.
%, which is timely given recent deployments of fleets of IoT devices, 5G networks, and diverse energy sources in increasingly ``smart'' cities.
