\caption{\textbf{Analytic results for linear control:} (a) By only representing information salient to a control task, our co-design method (orange) achieves the optimal control cost with  
$43\%$
% $1.75\times$ 
less data than a standard MSE approach (``task-agnostic'', blue). Formal definitions of all benchmarks are in Sec. \ref{sec:evaluation}. (b-c) By weighting prediction error by $\lambdaforecast > 0$, we learn representations that are compressible, have good predictive power, and lead to near-optimal control cost (\eg~ $\lambdaforecast=1.0$).
(d) For the \textit{same} timeseries $\bolds$, two different control tasks require various amounts of data shared, motivating our task-centric representations.}
